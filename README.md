## Intro
The main goal of _open.is_ is to simplify the process of business management. Despite the incredible and fast development in modern technology, there are still things that cannot be automated easily. Such things rely on human engagement and activity. The problem of keeping a reliable opening state of a business is a perfect example of a process which requires a business owner to be involved in. **Google Maps** are the greatest and the most popular solution for location browsing. However, I believe that Google Maps are focused mainly on other domains than business management, such as making it easy to travel and find places. For this reason, I am pretty sure you have faced a situation when a place which was open on Google Maps turned out to be closed in reality, which you realised having wasted your time, standing in front of a closed door. Nowadays, such problem is dependant on the activity of business owners and their will to keep the information reliable. _Open.is_ aims to engage business owners as deeply as it is possible, by preaching a simple principle, that _taking care of a business is a key to success_. This can be achieved by operating on pure statistics and numbers. The active business owner is a great success for everyone and the concept is extremely simple. Well conducted business attracts more clients. Our application makes it easy. It will make it much easier in the near future. Stay tuned.
